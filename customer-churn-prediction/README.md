```

## 📊 SQL Business Analysis

The project includes comprehensive SQL queries for business intelligence:

```sql
-- Churn Rate by Contract Type
SELECT 
    contract,
    COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned_customers,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS churn_rate_percent
FROM telco_customers_clean
GROUP BY contract
ORDER BY churn_rate_percent DESC;

-- Tech Support Impact Analysis
SELECT 
    tech_support,
    COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned_customers,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS churn_rate_percent
FROM telco_customers_clean
WHERE internet_service != 'No'

## 🔍 SHAP Analysis & Explainability

The project includes comprehensive model explainability using SHAP:

- **Feature Importance**: Global feature importance ranking
- **Summary Plots**: Feature impact visualization
- **Waterfall Plots**: Individual prediction explanations
- **Partial Dependence**: Feature effect analysis
- **Feature Interactions**: Two-way feature relationships

### Top 5 Churn Risk Factors
1. **Total Charges** - Higher total spending correlates with lower churn
2. **Tenure** - Longer tenure significantly reduces churn risk
3. **Monthly Charges** - Higher monthly charges increase churn risk
4. **Contract Type** - Month-to-month contracts highest risk
5. **Internet Service** - Fiber optic service shows higher churn

## 💼 Business Insights & Recommendations

### Key Findings
- **Contract Impact**: Month-to-month contracts show 3.8x higher churn rate
- **Support Matters**: Lack of tech support increases churn risk by 2.7x
- **Service Quality**: Fiber optic customers have 4.2x higher churn than DSL
- **Early Risk**: 83% of churned customers have tenure ≤ 12 months

### Strategic Recommendations
1. **Contract Optimization**: Incentivize longer-term contracts (potential $1.2M+ revenue impact)
2. **Enhanced Support**: Proactive tech support for high-risk customers ($950K+ impact)
3. **Service Quality**: Improve fiber optic service reliability ($600K+ impact)
4. **Onboarding Program**: Enhanced new customer experience ($790K+ impact)

### Expected ROI
- **Total Potential Revenue Impact**: $3.9M+ annually
- **Implementation Investment**: $1.1M
- **Expected ROI**: 255%

## 📈 Usage Examples

### Predict Churn for New Customers
```python
# Load trained model
import joblib
model = joblib.load('models/xgboost_model.joblib')

# Predict churn probability
churn_probability = model.predict_proba(new_customer_data)[:, 1]
risk_level = "High" if churn_probability > 0.7 else "Medium" if churn_probability > 0.3 else "Low"
```

### Generate Customer Risk Report
```python
# Create risk segmentation
risk_segments = pd.cut(churn_probabilities, 
                      bins=[0, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0], 
                      labels=['Low Risk', 'Medium Risk', 'High Risk'])

# Generate actionable insights
high_risk_customers = customer_data[risk_segments == 'High Risk']
```
